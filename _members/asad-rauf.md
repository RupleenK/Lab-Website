Biosketch: 
I am originally from Salt Lake City, UT (Go Jazz and Utes!). Iâ€™m fascinated by the power of computing and technology to transform the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and the development of new therapies. I spend my free time frequenting cafes, talking about sports, and enjoying nature.
