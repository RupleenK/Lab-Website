I am a postdoctoral research fellow interested in the modeling and monitoring of cancer evolution. I completed my undergraduate and master’s degree in physics at the University of Oxford and made the move to cancer biology for my PhD.

I studied ovarian cancer genomics and progression using image analysis and bioinformatics methods at the University of Cambridge. As a develop my own independent research direction I am developing digital twin approaches in oncology to personalise care. For me this involves combining modeling and informatics with imaging and modern digital health and wearable technology.

When I’m not at my computer I’m big on sports, and you’ll find me watching the Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Monsters, or wrestling as my alter ego Aiden von England.
