I am a postdoctoral research fellow interested in computational biology and biological modeling. I earned my PhD in physics researching biological and spatial networks in the Albert Lab at Penn State University. My previous work focused on understanding the relationships between a complex system’s structure and its function through computational modeling and simulations of networks. I am excited to apply these computational tools, and other-data-driven approaches, to further model and understand cancers. Outside of the lab, I like to cook, play board games, and watch movies, and I’ve also recently began picking up tennis.
