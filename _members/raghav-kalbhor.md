Hello! I am originally from a small town called Mars in Pennsylvania; it is about 30 minutes north of Pittsburgh. I currently go to college at Case Western Reserve University where I am a third-year undergraduate student. I am majoring in Biology and am on the pre-med track. Some fun facts about me: I have been playing golf for about 5 years now, and I have a 2 y/o husky named Rocky. In the Dhawan Lab, I am working to understand circRNA, a novel type of non-coding RNA molecule. I also am working on sequencing DNA and RNA using the MinION by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
